Last year, I played 47 different games (this info comes from _Steam Wrapped_) Nowadays, I mostly use Steam for video games since I can play with friends and use the same games on my PC, Steam Deck, or even on the TV by using the Steam Deck. This list includes the games I enjoyed the most. I left a lot of games unfinishedâ€¦ and I also finished some that had been unfinished before ðŸ˜Š

ðŸš¨ Disclaimer ðŸš¨ I mostly play puzzle and narrative games. What I love about puzzle and narrative games is that they help me disconnect more than anything. I love staying home on a Sunday evening playing games, and Iâ€™d say it's one of the things that helped me the most during the lowest days of the past year.

The list is in chronological order, and this is not a ranking, just the games I loved the most and what I liked about them.

* [Strange Horticulture](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574580/Strange_Horticulture/)

> Strange Horticulture is an occult puzzle game in which you play as the proprietor of a local plant store. Find and identify new plants, pet your cat, speak to a coven, or join a cult. Use your collection of powerful plants to influence the story and unravel Undermereâ€™s dark mysteries.

In January 2024, I caught one of the worst flus ever. My fever wouldnâ€™t go down for days, and I could barely stand, so this game was perfect to pass the time. I love that the entire narrative unfolds in a single scene: the plant store. Just by interacting with objects and the narration, you can transport yourself to other places without ever leaving the store, it feels like an escape room! Very entertaining and cozy, I highly recommend playing it with a nice cup of coffee.

* [Chants of Sennaar](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931770/Chants_of_Sennaar/)

> In this award-winning puzzle adventure game, play as the Traveler on a quest to reunite the Peoples of the Tower. Observe, listen, and decipher ancient languages in a fascinating universe inspired by the Myth of Babel.

I know I said this isn't a ranking, butâ€¦ this game has made it into my top 5 favorite games ever. The language mechanics work incredibly well, itâ€™s so satisfying to decode the glyphs and progress through the different civilizations of the tower (`L^=L"`). Also, the color palette and aesthetic are really pleasant, and I loved the various perspectives of each scene. The only thing I didnâ€™t enjoy much was playing with a keyboard and mouse, I think I wouldâ€™ve liked it more with a controller.

* [COCOON](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1497440/COCOON/)

> From Jeppe Carlsen, the lead gameplay designer of LIMBO and INSIDE â€” COCOON takes you on an adventure across worlds within worlds. Master world-leaping mechanics and solve intricate puzzles to unravel a cosmic mystery.

![COCOON Screenshot](/img/games/cocoon.jpg)

Worlds within worlds within worlds. I love recursive mechanics, and in this case, it was really fun solving the challenges as they became increasingly complex. Plus, this game has boss fights after each level, making it even more interesting, not just puzzle-solving but also requiring some skill.

* [ABZÃ›](https://store.steampowered.com/app/384190/ABZU/)

> ABZÃ› is a beautiful underwater adventure that evokes the dream of diving. Immerse yourself in a vibrant hidden world bursting with color and life as you descend into the heart of the ocean. But beware as you swim deeper as dangers lurk in the depths. 

![ABZÃ› Screenshot](/img/games/abzu.jpg)

As a fan of Journey and The Pathless, of course, I loved ABZÃ›. It's very short, very cozy, very chill. A brief underwater story that feels like a warm embrace.

* [CLeM](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1861440/CLeM/)

>  CLeM is a narrative-driven puzzle adventure game with a dark twist. Wake up in a world where puzzles intertwine with exploration, weaving a unique narrative rooted in alchemy. A voice awakens you. It gives you purpose. To guide you, you find a notebook with mysterious entries and a house to explore. 

![CLeM Screenshot](/img/games/clem.jpg)

This game by [Mango Protocol](https://www.mangoprotocol.com/) was released on my birthday... how could I not play it? The creators describe its genre as _puzzlevania_, a concept I love and one that should definitely be used more often because it perfectly defines my favorite type of game. The story is very entertaining and engaging, but what I love the most is the 2D hand-drawn aesthetic, which adds a personal touch that, in my opinion, gives it a lot of value.

* [American Arcadia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1249040/American_Arcadia/)

![American Arcadia Screenshot](/img/games/american_arcadia.jpg)

> American Arcadia is a cinematic puzzle game that combines a 2.5D platformer and first-person game to tell the tale of a thrilling escape. Experience the extraordinary story of Trevor, an average man escaping from the world's most popular reality tv show. 

Another game by Out of the Blue, the studio behind one of my all-time favorite games (Call of the Sea), so I bought it instantly when it was released last year. I really enjoyed it and found the story interesting, although I wish I couldâ€™ve interacted more with the environments. Itâ€™s completely narrative-driven, with almost no skill challenges or complex puzzles, itâ€™s a story you simply experience. This studio makes incredible games, and I canâ€™t wait to see what they release next.

* [Tales from Candleforth](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2200410/Tales_from_Candleforth/)

> Tales from Candleforth is a folk horror 2D point and click game with puzzles and escape room mechanics, that narrates the fairy tales from the village. The text contained in this ancient and evil book is now bleeding out, mixing the world of nightmares with the real one through handmade 2D graphics.

![Tales from Candleforth Screenshot](/img/games/tales_from_candleforth.jpg)

I discovered this game at [Guadalindie](https://guadalindie.com/), a MÃ¡lagaâ€™s indie video game event. I played the demo and later completed the full game, I loved it. Folk horror and puzzles, what more could you ask for? I enjoyed the dark aesthetic, the mystery, and the originality of the puzzles.

* [Carto](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172450/Carto/)

> Carto is a charming adventure game wrapped around a unique, world-altering puzzle mechanic. Use this power to explore mysterious lands, help a quirky cast of characters, and guide Carto on her journey back to her family. 

![Carto Screenshot](/img/games/carto.jpg)

Carto is one of those cozy-looking games that may seem like theyâ€™re just for kids but actually hold a pleasant surprise for puzzle lovers. A story that warms your heart, with puzzles that arenâ€™t as trivial as they might seem at first glance, and it plays really well on the Steam Deck.

* [Tick Tock - A Tale of Two](https://store.steampowered.com/app/790740/Tick_Tock_A_Tale_for_Two/)

> You and your friend are trapped in a mystical world. As time ebbs away you must solve increasingly complex puzzles to escape. Cooperation is key as neither of you have the full picture! Play on two devices, local or remotely, all you need is a voice connection.

![Tick Tock - A Tale of Two Screenshot](/img/games/tick_tock.jpg)

This game had been sitting in my library collecting dust for yearsâ€¦ because itâ€™s a co-op game, and it took me a while to find someone to play it with. Itâ€™s very similar to others like Tales from Candleforth or Clem, a puzzle-based point-and-click game. But the co-op element adds a unique twist: it can be played offline. Each player sees different things, and the game isnâ€™t synchronized in any way, itâ€™s up to the players to communicate and figure out how to solve the puzzles. I highly recommend it, both for playing remotely with someone or for playing in the same house without looking at each otherâ€™s screens, almost like a board game.

* [Pilgrims](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1049280/Pilgrims/)

>  Pilgrims is a playful adventure game, created by the team behind Machinarium and Samorost. Roam the land as you please and make new friends, share a laugh with your fellow travelers and help them complete their little stories, your way. How many different solutions can you find?

![Pilgrims Screenshot](/img/games/pilgrims.jpg)

A short, charming, simple, cozy game with an awesome soundtrack. Itâ€™s fun, quick to play, and you can replay the story multiple times to achieve different narrative goals marked in a deck of cards.

* [Lorelei and the Laser Eyes](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2008920/Lorelei_and_the_Laser_Eyes/)

> The stage is set. Imagine an old baroque manor, perhaps a hotel or a museum, somewhere in central Europe. A woman wanders in search of answers.

![Lorelei and the Laser Eyes Screenshot](/img/games/lorelei.jpg)

It's been a pleasure to play this game, I loved it from the first second till the end. I mostly liked the art, how the view of each scene was built, the multiple labyrinths, and all the meta references within the game. Many of the puzzles are connected and are part of the narrative itself. Sometimes this makes them "easier" to solve, even without having a unique mechanic. But that's something I liked because although it was repetitive, this repetition is, from my point of view, intentional.

I understand it can be boring at some point, but it's part of the story of the game. And in this game, the story is quite important, so you learn it through repetition. One of the issues the game might have is that there are very specific puzzles that, if you miss them, block you for quite a lot of time, and there are no hints at all. Along with the art, the music was delightful.

And I particularly loved a detail that people might miss if they don't know the studio: [Simogo](https://simogo.com/). I'm not going to say where, but there are references to their games in this one. I actually didn't know this game was from them (sorry for that) until I found that reference because years ago I played DEVICE 6. DEVICE 6 has the same vibes, but it's a mobile game. Not only did I love the game, but I also think it has one of the best songs ever in a video game: ["Anna"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2okhVcWmNs)

* Epilogue: [The Witness](https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/)

> You wake up, alone, on a strange island full of puzzles that will challenge and surprise you.

![The Witness Screenshot](/img/games/the_witness.png)

This is kind of cheating because I started playing The Witness over three years ago and left it unfinished. Thanks to some friends who recently started playing it, I got hooked again, and we got really competitive. This game needs no introduction, but I have to say that one of my most exciting moments of the year wasnâ€™t just finishing the game: it was achieving the second achievement (the "challenge").
